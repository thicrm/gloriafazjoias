# Gloria Faz Joias - Website Development Instructions

## Overview
This website works in conjunction with Nuvemshop. Products are registered in Nuvemshop and payments are handled by Nuvemshop. The website serves as a custom storefront that displays products with custom styling and images. **The entire purchase process (add to cart, checkout, payment) should happen within the website using Nuvemshop widgets or embeds** - no redirects to external Nuvemshop pages.

## Nuvemshop Integration Strategy

### Best Integration Approach
**Hybrid Model**: Custom frontend with Nuvemshop backend (embedded widgets)
- Products are registered and managed in Nuvemshop
- Payments and checkout are handled entirely by Nuvemshop **within the website using widgets/embeds**
- Website displays products with custom images and styling
- Product pages embed Nuvemshop buy buttons/widgets for seamless in-site checkout
- Cart and checkout process embedded using Nuvemshop widgets/iframes
- Optional: Use Nuvemshop API to fetch product metadata (prices, availability) if real-time sync is needed

### Data Structure
Each product should have:
- **Name**: Used for organization and routing (slug generation)
- **Nuvemshop Product Link**: Direct URL to the product page on Nuvemshop
- **Image Group**: Multiple images provided in a txt file, organized by product name
- **Category**: For filtering and organization
- **Material**: For filtering
- **Price**: Can be fetched from API or stored locally

### Implementation Details
1. **Product Data Source**: 
   - Product links will be provided manually
   - Images will be provided in a txt file, organized by product name
   - Each product name maps to its image group

2. **Product Cards**:
   - Display custom images (from provided txt file)
   - Show product name, category, material, and price
   - Link to custom product page (not directly to Nuvemshop)
   - Styled similarly to Prounis Jewelry product grid

3. **Product Pages**:
   - Individual page for each product: `/products/[product-slug]`
   - Display all images from the product's image group
   - Show product details (name, description, price, etc.)
   - **Embed Nuvemshop buy button/widget** for adding to cart (stays within website)
   - Styled similarly to Prounis Jewelry individual product pages
   - All purchase interactions happen on-site using Nuvemshop widgets/embeds

4. **Product Organization**:
   - Products organized by name
   - Product name is used to:
     - Generate URL slug for routing
     - Match images from the txt file
     - Organize and display products
