# Products Database Documentation

## File: products-database.txt

### Purpose
This file contains the complete product catalog for Gloria Faz Joias, including product names and their associated image URLs.

### Format Structure
- **Product Name**: First line of each product entry (e.g., "anel bruto latão")
- **Image URLs**: One URL per line, listed below the product name
- **Separator**: Blank line between each product entry

### Example Entry
```
anel bruto latão
https://pub-5d1481d6cba449089a45cbcb47b01ed9.r2.dev/anel%20bruto%20lat%C3%A3o/DSC00205.jpg
https://pub-5d1481d6cba449089a45cbcb47b01ed9.r2.dev/anel%20bruto%20lat%C3%A3o/DSC00206.jpg
https://pub-5d1481d6cba449089a45cbcb47b01ed9.r2.dev/anel%20bruto%20lat%C3%A3o/DSC00209.jpg

[blank line before next product]
```

## How It's Used in Development

### 1. Product Data Parsing
The `lib/products.ts` file reads this database and:
- Parses product names and their image URLs
- Generates URL slugs from product names (e.g., "anel bruto latão" → "anel-bruto-latao")
- Extracts category from product name (e.g., "anel" → "Anéis", "colar" → "Colares")
- Extracts material from product name (e.g., "prata", "ouro", "latão")
- Creates Product objects with all necessary data

### 2. Product Cards
- **First Image**: Displayed by default on product card
- **Second Image**: Shown on hover (if product has 2+ images)
- Product name, category, and material are displayed below the image

### 3. Individual Product Pages
- **Image Grid**: All product images displayed in a grid (similar to home page grid)
- **Selected Image**: Large display above the grid showing the currently selected image
- **Product Info**: Displayed below the selected image

### 4. Category and Material Extraction
Categories are extracted from product names:
- "anel" → "Anéis"
- "colar" → "Colares"
- "brinco" → "Brincos"
- "bracelete" → "Braceletes"
- "pingente" → "Pingentes"
- "marca páginas" → "Acessórios"
- "conjunto" → "Conjuntos"

Materials are extracted from product names:
- "prata" → "Prata"
- "ouro" → "Ouro"
- "latão" → "Latão"
- Default: "Não especificado" if no material found

### 5. Slug Generation
Product names are converted to URL-friendly slugs:
- Lowercase
- Spaces replaced with hyphens
- Special characters normalized (é → e, ç → c, etc.)
- Example: "anel céu estrelado" → "anel-ceu-estrelado"

## Data Structure

Each product in the codebase will have this structure:
```typescript
{
  id: string                    // Generated from product name
  name: string                  // Full product name from database
  slug: string                  // URL-friendly version of name
  images: string[]              // Array of all image URLs
  category: string              // Extracted from name
  material: string              // Extracted from name
  nuvemshopId?: string          // To be added when Nuvemshop links are provided
  nuvemshopUrl?: string         // To be added when Nuvemshop links are provided
  price?: number                // To be fetched from API or added manually
  description?: string          // To be added later
}
```

## Adding New Products

To add a new product:
1. Add product name on a new line
2. Add image URLs below the name (one per line)
3. Add a blank line before the next product
4. The system will automatically:
   - Generate a slug
   - Extract category and material
   - Make it available in the shop

## Notes

- All image URLs are hosted on R2 storage
- Product names are case-sensitive and should match exactly
- Image order matters: first image is default, second is hover image
- Products with only one image will show the same image on hover
